Tips and Potential Improvements
Transition Smoothness:

Ensure that the app's launch feels smooth and responsive, without noticeable lag or flickering when transitioning from the lock screen to your app.
Customization Options:

Allow users to customize the background image or theme of the app UI for a more personalized experience.
Include options to choose between light and dark modes for better readability.
App Exit Behavior:

Ensure that users can easily exit your app after unlocking if they want to return to the home screen or another app.
Consider adding a button or gesture for quick navigation.
Add Optional Widgets:

Enhance the app by adding optional widgets or features, such as:
A small calendar.
A quick-view battery percentage.
Today's to-do list or reminders.
Settings Menu:

Provide a settings menu where users can:
Adjust the time reset behavior (e.g., reset at custom times instead of 6 AM).
Manage app permissions or stats display preferences.
Enable/disable the app overlay after unlocking.
Performance Optimization:

Ensure your app is lightweight and does not significantly impact battery life or device performance, especially for users who frequently unlock their phones.
Onboarding Experience:

For new users, add a brief walkthrough or tutorial to explain how the app works and what they can expect.
Future Additions to Consider
Analytics for Users:

Provide insights into usage trends over time (e.g., "Your most-used app this week is...").
Compare today's usage to the previous day or week.
Focus Mode or Reminders:

Include a focus mode that alerts users if they've spent too much time on certain apps.
Add gentle reminders to take breaks from the phone.
Dynamic Backgrounds:

Rotate the background image based on time of day or other conditions (e.g., weather, app usage).
